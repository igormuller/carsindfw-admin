        Dallas is proud of its western heritage and runs away from the
        traditional image of a deserted western city, which tourists hope to
        find in Texas, south of the United States. Luxurious, full of cars and
        shopping malls, Dallas is a city rich in tall buildings and wide
        avenues. Dallas cowboys walk around displaying their boots and belts and
        contrasting the modernity of shopping centers with the world of cattle
        and oil. Preceded by thousands of years of varying cultures, the Caddo
        people inhabited the Dallas area before Spanish colonists claimed the
        territory of Texas in the 18th century as a part of the Viceroyalty of
        New Spain. Later, France also claimed the area but never established
        much settlement. In all, six flags have flown over the area preceding
        and during the city's history: those of France, Spain, and Mexico, the
        flag of the Republic of Texas, the Confederate flag, and the flag of the
        United States of America.

        In 1819, the Adams-Onís Treaty between the United States and Spain
        defined the Red River as the northern boundary of New Spain, officially
        placing the future location of Dallas well within Spanish territory. The
        area remained under Spanish rule until 1821, when Mexico declared
        independence from Spain, and the area was considered part of the Mexican
        state of Coahuila y Tejas. In 1836, Texians, with a majority of
        Anglo-American settlers, gained independence from Mexico and formed the
        Republic of Texas.

        Three years after Texas achieved independence, John Neely Bryan surveyed
        the area around present-day Dallas. In 1839, accompanied by his dog and
        a Cherokee he called Ned, he planted a stake in the ground on a bluff
        located near three forks of the Trinity River and left. Two years later,
        in 1841, he returned to establish a permanent settlement named Dallas.
        The origin of the name is uncertain. The official historical marker
        states it was named after Vice President George M. Dallas of
        Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. However, this is disputed. Other potential
        theories for the origin include his brother, Commodore Alexander James
        Dallas, as well as brothers Walter R. Dallas or James R. Dallas. A
        further theory gives the ultimate origin as the village of Dallas,
        Moray, Scotland, similar to the way Houston, Texas was named after Sam
        Houston whose ancestors came from the Scottish village of Houston,
        Renfrewshire. The Republic of Texas was annexed by the United States in
        1845 and Dallas County was established the following year. Dallas was
        formally incorporated as a city on February 2, 1856. In the mid-1800s, a
        group of French Socialists established La Réunion, a short-lived
        community, along the Trinity River in what is now West Dallas.

        With the construction of railroads, Dallas became a business and trading
        center and was booming by the end of the 19th century. It became an
        industrial city, attracting workers from Texas, the South, and the
        Midwest. The Praetorian Building in Dallas of 15 stories, built in 1909,
        was the first skyscraper west of the Mississippi and the tallest
        building in Texas for some time. It marked the prominence of Dallas as a
        city. A racetrack for thoroughbreds was built and their owners
        established the Dallas Jockey Club. Trotters raced at a track in Fort
        Worth, where a similar drivers club was based. The rapid expansion of
        population increased competition for jobs and housing.
