        <h3 style="color: #00205b">Inspect the car, preferably in person:</h3>
        <p>* Be wary of sellers who refuse to meet in person, face to face.</p>
        <p>
          * Use caution if the seller only wants to communicate via email or
          text message.
        </p>
        <p>
          * Be extremely wary if the seller refuses to or claims they cannot
          talk on the phone.
        </p>
        <p>
          * If possible, have a car mechanic join you and inspect the vehicle
          before you pay to complete a sale.
        </p>
        <p>
          * Exercise caution if the seller states the vehicle must be shipped or
          is currently not in their physical possession.
        </p>
        <h3 style="color: #00205b">Learn about a vehicleâ€™s history:</h3>
        <p>
          Consider purchasing a vehicle history report such as those offered by
          Carfax. While vehicle history reports do not necessarily include every
          piece of information about a used car, they can be a helpful tool to
          identify major issues or defects, general location and more.<br />
          It can be indicative of auto fraud if the seller is unable or
          unwilling to provide the vehicle identification number or a copy of
          the title.
